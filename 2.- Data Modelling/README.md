# Data Modelling

In this part of the project, I transition from a single cleaned dataset to a structured and optimized model that facilitates analysis in SQL and Power BI.

## Objectives

- Create new calculated columns (feature engineering) that will add value to the analysis.
- Split the cleaned dataset into several smaller, focused tables.
- Design a star schema to ensure clarity, performance, and scalability in the analytical tools.
