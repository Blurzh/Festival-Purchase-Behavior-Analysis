# Music-Festival-Analysis

## Description

This project explores the purchasing behavior of attendees at a 3-day music festival in May 2025. Using a synthetic dataset of 14,000 entries, the goal is to understand how ticket type choices relate to other attendee characteristics and behaviors.

## Objective

To analyze how the type of ticket purchased (e.g., General, VIP, Full Pass) reflects differences in attendee profiles, payment preferences, attendance patterns, and overall satisfaction. The aim is to provide actionable insights to event organizers and marketing teams.

## Key Business Questions

- What are the most popular ticket types?
- How do ticket preferences vary by age, gender, and musical taste?
- Are certain ticket types associated with specific payment methods?
- Do people who attend multiple days tend to choose a particular ticket?
- Is there a link between ticket type and satisfaction or likelihood to recommend the festival?

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas)
- SQL
- Git/GitHub
- CSV files (raw and cleaned versions)
- Power BI
